## Getting started

### Installation

Launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command, and press enter.

```sh
ext install brpaz.vscode-obsidianmd
```

## Usage


### Set up your vault path

Before using this extension, you have to configure the path to your Obsidian Vault.

Open VS Code Settings, and search for "Obsidian". Then set up the absolute path for your vault directory, on your system.

After that, the extension should pick your changes and start indexing your vault. If not, or anytime you want to reindex your vault, just open the Command Palette and execute the command `ObsidianMD: Index Vault`

### Searching on your vault

After your vault was successfully indexed, open command palette and type: `ObsidianMd: Search`. A list of all your notes will be presented and you can filter the results.

Clicking on an item, will open the note contents in the side of your open editor. You can also click on the little icon, in the right, which will open the note directly in Obsidian instead.

| `obsidianmd.excludedDirectories`           | array   | `[]`          | A list of Vault directories that will be excluded from the index                                                        |
| `obsidianmd.includeOnlyWithFrontmatterKey` | boolean | `false`       | If this option is set to true only notes with frontmatter key `"brpaz.vscode-obsidianmd/include: true"` will be indexed |

### `obsidianmd.vaultPath`

* Type: `string`
* Default Value: `""`
* Description: Path to your Obsidian vault

This setting allows you to specify the path to your Obsidian vault. The Obsidian vault is the directory where your notes are stored. By default, this setting is an empty string. You must set this value before being able to use the extension.

### `obsidianmd.excludedDirectories`

* Type: `array`
* Default Value: `[]`
* Description: A list of Vault directories that will be excluded from the index

This setting allows you to exclude specific directories within your vault from being indexed. You can specify one or more directories in an array. By default, this setting is an empty array, which means that all directories within the vault will be indexed.

When specifying directories, use only the path starting from the Vault folder.

### `obsidianmd.includeOnlyWithFrontmatterKey`

* Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `false`
* Description: If this option is set to true only notes with frontmatter key `"brpaz.vscode-obsidianmd/include: true"` will be indexed

This setting allows you to control which notes are indexed based on the presence of a specific frontmatter key. If this setting is set to `true`, only notes that have a frontmatter key with the value `"true"` for `"brpaz.vscode-obsidianmd/include"` will be indexed. By default, this setting is `false`, which means that all notes in the vault will be indexed.
